Must be between 1 and n-1 where n is the total number of points.\nscore::Symbol: A symbol representing the score function to use (e.g., :r2, :cor, :tv).

This facilitates the identification of an optimal separating hyperplane.\nIt then performs a topological sweep, iterating over candidate subsets (k-sets) to efficiently search for the subset with the highest score.\nIf the dataset size n is less than or equal to the embedding dimension d (from the score function), or if k <= d, the function falls back to a brute-force search.\n\nNotes\n\nThe function uses a combination of combinatorics and linear algebra to determine the optimal subset.\nThe score function and the corresponding lifting transformation are retrieved based on the provided score symbol.\nThe method ensures efficiency by skipping a brute-force search when possible, instead leveraging the topological sweep to reduce the number of computations.\n\nThrows\n\nAssertionError if x and y do not meet the required constraints (k < n, x and y are the same size).\nErrorException if the score symbol is invalid or not available in SCORE_FUNCTIONS.\n\nExample\n\n```julia bestidxs, bestscore = sweep([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], [2.0, 3.0, 6.0, 8.0]; k = 2, score = :r2)\n\nSee also\n\nbrute_force: The fallback method for an exhaustive search.\ncheck_input: Validates inputs and retrieves the score function configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
